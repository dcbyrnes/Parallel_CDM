Data Partitioning for Distributed Support Vector Machines
CS 315B Final Project
Author: Daniel C. Byrnes

INTRO:
This project explores the use of the clustering algorithms K-means and kernel K-means for partitioning the training and test datasets to enable distributed SVMs. This scheme was shown to lower training time while preserving the predictive quality of the SVM classifier.  

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. The file 'partitions' in the 'src' folder contains data partitions for the training and test ijcnn1 datasets. 
If you wish to re-cluster the data using K-means clustering then from the 'src' folder type type
    >> 'python cluster.py'

Note: open-source kernel K-means code was used for the kernel K-means partitioning. That code can be found here https://gist.github.com/mblondel/6230787.


2. The distributed SVM code requires that you have Regent installed on your computer. 
Instructions for installing Regent can be found here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs315b/assignment0.html.
To run the distributed SVM program enter: 
    >> './regent.py clustered_svm.rg'
